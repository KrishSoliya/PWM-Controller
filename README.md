# PWM Controller Design in LTspice

This repository contains the design and simulation of a **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller** using LTspice. The PWM controller is a crucial component in applications such as motor control, power supplies, and signal modulation.

## Key Features

- **Precise Duty Cycle Control**: Designed to generate PWM signals with adjustable duty cycles.
- **Simulation Environment**: Fully simulated using LTspice for accurate analysis.
- **Versatile Applications**: Suitable for motor speed control, LED dimming, and other embedded systems.

## System Design

1. **Oscillator Circuit**: Generates a sawtooth waveform for PWM signal generation.
2. **Comparator Circuit**: Compares the reference voltage to control the duty cycle.
3. **Output Driver**: Drives the load with the generated PWM signal.

## Technologies Used

- **Design Tool**: LTspice
- **Components**: Operational amplifiers, resistors, capacitors, and other basic electronic components.
